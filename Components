# Components of NIRBHAYA: The Securix

The **NIRBHAYA** app is a Python-based desktop application designed to enhance personal safety. It integrates **real-time face detection, emotion detection, voice recording/playback, and GPS tracking** into a single interface using **PyQt6**. Below are the detailed components:

---

## 1. GUI Component (PyQt6)
**Purpose:** Provides the main interface for user interaction.  

**Features:**
- Buttons for each feature:
  - Start Face Detection
  - Detect Emotion
  - Record Voice
  - Play Recording
  - Show Location
- Uses a **vertical layout (`QVBoxLayout`)** to organize elements.
- Handles user interactions using **signal-slot connections**.
- Displays alerts and messages using **QMessageBox** for location or errors.

**Python Module:** `PyQt6.QtWidgets`

---

## 2. Face Detection Component
**Purpose:** Detects faces in real-time using the computer camera.  

**Features:**
- Captures video feed from the webcam (`cv2.VideoCapture`).
- Uses OpenCV's **Haar Cascade Classifier** for face detection.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Runs continuously until the user quits by pressing `q`.

**Python Module:** `cv2` (OpenCV)

---

## 3. Emotion Detection Component
**Purpose:** Detects emotions (Happy, Neutral, Sad, Nervous) from facial landmarks.  

**Features:**
- Uses **MediaPipe Face Mesh** for detecting detailed facial landmarks.
- Analyzes mouth and eyebrow positions to classify emotions.
- Displays emotion labels directly on the video feed.
- Runs in real-time and continuously updates until the user quits.

**Python Module:** `mediapipe`, `cv2`

---

## 4. Voice Recording and Playback Component
**Purpose:** Records and plays audio for user safety or alerts.  

**Features:**
- Records audio from the microphone using `sounddevice`.
- Saves recordings as `voice_recording.wav`.
- Plays audio recordings via the system's default media player.
- Default recording duration: 5 seconds (can be adjusted).

**Python Module:** `sounddevice`, `scipy.io.wavfile`, `os`

---

## 5. GPS Location Component
**Purpose:** Provides the user's current geographic location.  

**Features:**
- Fetches location using IP-based geocoding (`geocoder.ip('me')`).
- Displays latitude and longitude in a popup.
- Handles errors if location cannot be retrieved.

**Python Module:** `geocoder`

---

## 6. Entry Point
**Purpose:** Initializes the application and launches the GUI.  

**Features:**
- Creates a **QApplication** instance.
- Displays the main `NirbhayaApp` window.
- Ensures clean exit of the application using `sys.exit(app.exec())`.

**Python Module:** `sys`, `PyQt6.QtWidgets`
