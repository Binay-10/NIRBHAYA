Abstract – NIRBHAYA: The Securix (a nxt-gen security)
Personal safety continues to be a major concern, with delayed response times, lack of reliable communication in remote areas, and limited monitoring tools making individuals, especially women and vulnerable groups, highly vulnerable. Existing safety solutions are often restricted to mobile applications without strong hardware integration or active deterrence mechanisms.

NIRBHAYA addresses this gap by providing a hybrid safety and security system that integrates IoT-enabled hardware with AI-driven applications for real-time emergency response. The system uses ESP32 and Arduino microcontrollers, GPS, and GSM modules to ensure live location tracking and instant distress communication. To further strengthen reliability, future integration with ISRO’s satellite services is planned, enabling 24×7 continuous tracking even in offline or no-network environments. A handmade taser gun and vibration alerts serve as active deterrents, while AI-powered facial recognition, live audio, and video streaming provide evidence and situational awareness to responders.

On the software side, NIRBHAYA offers cross-platform desktop and mobile applications for monitoring, geo-fenced alerts, and incident logging. The modular design ensures flexibility, affordability, and scalability, making it suitable for wide adoption.

By merging IoT, AI, and satellite connectivity, NIRBHAYA empowers individuals to trigger immediate alerts, reduces emergency response times, and assists authorities with actionable intelligence—ultimately creating a safer and more secure environment.
